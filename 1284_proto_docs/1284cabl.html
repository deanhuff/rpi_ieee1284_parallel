            <p align="left">
              In order to guarantee high performance operation, 10 Meter cable
              lengths, and interoperability among various platforms and peripherals,
              the 1284 standard defines the characteristics for the cable assemblies.
              </p>
            <p align="left">Contrary
              to popular belief, there is no such thing as a "standard"
              parallel printer cable. This typically refers to a cable assembly
              with a DB25 male on one end and a 36 pin Champ plug connector on
              the other end. Internally, the cables may have from 18 to 25 conductors,
              with 1 to 8 ground wires, they may have foil shielding and/or braid,
              and possibly a drain wire. With this type of assembly there is no
              way to control the cable impedance, crosstalk, capacitance and performance.
              This type of assembly is fine for operation at 10K bytes per second
              at 6 ft., but will not work reliably at 2M byte per second at 30
              ft. cable lengths. </p>
            <p align="left">Some
              of the parameters for a compliant 1284 cable assembly include:
            </p><div align="left">
              <ol>
                <li>All
                  signals are twisted pair with a signal and ground return </li>
                <li>Each
                  signal and ground return has a characteristic unbalanced impedance
                  of 62 +/- 6 ohms over the frequency band of 4 to 16 MHz </li>
                <li>The
                  wire-to-wire crosstalk is to be no greater than 10% </li>
                <li>The
                  cable will have a minimum of 85% optical braid coverage over
                  foil. </li>
                <li>The
                  cable shield shall be connected to the connector backshell using
                  a 360 degree concentric method. A pigtail connection is not
                  acceptable. </li>
                <li>Compliant
                  cable assemblies shall be marked with: "IEEE Std 1284-1994
                  Compliant" </li>

              refer to the 1284 standard for the complete list of requirements
              for a compliant cable assembly. The standard defines a number of
              different cable assembly configurations. For information on the

              cable lengths are available in 10 ft., 20 ft. and 30 ft. from some
              manufacturers. Since this cable has such good performance there
              is no need to be limited to a 6 ft. cable assembly. </p>
