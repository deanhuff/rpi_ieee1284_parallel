              <b>Parallel Port Background</b></h1>
            <p align="left">When
              IBM introduced the PC, in 1981, the parallel printer port was included
              as an alternative to the slower serial port as a means for driving
              the latest high performance dot matrix printers. The parallel port
              had the capability to transfer 8 bits of data at time whereas the
              serial port transmitted one bit at a time. When the PC was introduced,
              dot matrix printers were the main peripheral that used the parallel
              port. As technology progressed and the need for greater external
              connectivity increased, the parallel port became the means by which
              you could connect higher performance peripherals. These peripherals
              now range from printer sharing devices, portable disk drives and
              tape backup to local area network adapters and CD ROM players. </p>
            <p align="left">The
              problems faced by developers and customers of these peripherals
              fall into three categories. First, although the performance of the
              PC has increased dramatically, there has been virtually no change
              in the parallel port performance or architecture. The maximum data
              transfer rate achievable with this architecture is around 150 kilobytes
              per second and is extremely software intensive. Second, there is
              no standard for the electrical interface. This causes many problems
              when attempting to guarantee operation across various platforms.
              Finally, the lack of design standards forced a distance limitation
              of only 6 feet for external cables. </p>
            <p align="left">In
              1991 there was a meeting of printer manufacturers to start discussions
              on developing a new standard for the intelligent control of printers
              over a network. These manufacturers, which included Lexmark, IBM,
              Texas Instruments and others, formed the Network Printing Alliance.
              The NPA defined a set of parameters that, when implemented in the
              printer and host, will allow for the complete control of printer
              applications and jobs. </p>
            <p align="left">While
              this work was in progress it became apparent that to fully implement
              this standard would require a high performance bi-directional connection
              to the PC. The usual means of connection, the ordinary PC parallel
              port, did not have the capabilities required to meet the full requirements
              or abilities of this standard. </p>
            <p align="left">The
              NPA submitted a proposal to the IEEE for the creation of a committee
              to develop a new standard for a high speed bi-directional parallel
              port for the PC. It was a requirement that this new standard would
              remain fully compatible with the original parallel port software
              and peripherals, but would increase the data rate capability to
              greater than 1M bytes per second, both in and out of the computer.
              This committee became the IEEE 1284 committee. </p>
            <p align="left">The
              IEEE 1284 standard, "Standard Signaling Method for a Bi-directional
              Parallel Peripheral Interface for Personal Computers", was
              approved for final release in March of 1994. </p>
            <h3 align="left">The
              Parallel Port -- an Overview</h3>
            <p align="left">The
              parallel port, as implemented on the PC, consists of a connector
              with 17 signal lines and 8 ground lines. The signal lines are divided
              into three groups:
            </p><div align="left">
              <ul>
                <li>Control
                  (4 lines) </li>
                <li>Status
                  (5 lines) </li>
                <li>Data
                  (8 lines) </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p align="left">As
              originally designed, the Control lines are used as interface control
              and handshaking signals from the PC to the printer. The Status lines
              are used for handshake signals and as status indicators for such
              things as paper empty, busy indication and interface or peripheral
              errors. The data lines are used to provide data from the PC to the
              printer, in that direction only. Later implementations of the parallel
              port allowed for data to be driven from the peripheral to the PC.
              </p>
            <p align="left">Table
              1 identifies each of these signals and gives their Standard Parallel
              Port (SPP) definitions. The signals within these groups are assigned
              to specific bits within the registers that make up the hardware/software
              interface to the parallel port. The parallel port is mapped into
              the I/O space of the PC. The registers consist as a contiguous block
              of 3 registers starting from the parallel port's base address. These
              ports are commonly referred to as the LPT ports and have the familiar
              I/O base addresses of 3BCh, 378h and 278h. Newer implementations
              of the parallel port, that support the advanced modes of the 1284
              standard, use 8 to 16 registers and are located at I/O addresses
              378h or 278h, or are re-locatable, as in the case of a Plug and
              Play compliant parallel adapter. </p>
            <p align="left">Table
              2 identifies the registers for the standard parallel port. The basic
              method of transferring data to the printer using this port is described
              in the section entitled "Compatibility Mode." </p>

              1284 Data Transfer Modes</b></h3>
            <p align="left">The
              use of the various 1284 data transfer modes provide the capability
              to create a forward and reverse channel connection between the host
              computer and an attached peripheral. Since there is only one set
              of data lines the connection is half duplex, data is transferred
              in one direction at a time. </p>
            <p align="left">The
              Compatibility and Nibble modes of operation can be implemented in
              any existing parallel port in order to create a complete bi-directional
              communication path between the host and peripheral. The Compatibility
              and Byte modes can also be used create a bi-directional communication
              path, but the the parallel port must support the Byte mode capability.
              The Byte mode requires that an entire byte of data can be read from
              the external data lines. This is usually implemented by the addition
              of a direction bit in the parallel port's Control register. This
              type of port is generally called a "bi-directional" parallel
              port. </p>
            <p align="left">The
              EPP and ECP modes have bi-directional capability as part of their
              protocol. These modes require that the hardware implement a state
              machine that is capable of automatically generating the control
              strobes that are necessary for these high performance data transfer
              modes. </p>

              mode being discussed. <br>
