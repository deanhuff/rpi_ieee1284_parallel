              section is implemented as a multilevel document. This page serves
              as an executive summary of the 1284 standard. By clicking on the

              The recently released standard,<em> "IEEE Std.1284-1994 Standard
              Signaling Method for a Bi-directional Parallel Peripheral Interface
              for Personal Computers"</em>, is for the parallel port what
              the Pentium processor is to the 286. The standard provides for high
              speed bi-directional communication between the PC and an external
              peripheral that can communicate 50 to 100 times faster than the
              original parallel port. It can do this and still be fully backward
              compatible with all existing parallel port peripherals and printers.</p>

            <p align="left">The
              1284 standard defines 5 modes of data transfer. Each mode provides
              a method of transferring data in either the forward direction (PC
              to peripheral), reverse direction (peripheral to PC) or bi-directional
              data transfer (half duplex). The defined modes are: </p>

            </div>
            <p align="left">All
              parallel ports can implement a bi-directional link by using the
              Compatible and Nibble modes for data transfer. Byte mode can be
              utilized by about 25% of the installed base of parallel ports. All
              three of these modes utilize software only to transfer the data.
              The driver has to write the data, check the handshake lines (i.e.:
              BUSY), assert the appropriate control signals (i.e.: STROBE) and
              then go on to the next byte. This is very software intensive and
              limits the effective data transfer rate to 50 to 100 Kbytes per
              second.</p>
            <p align="left">In
              addition to the previous 3 modes, EPP and ECP are being implemented
              on the latest I/O controllers by most of the Super I/O chip manufacturers.
              These modes use hardware to assist in the data transfer. For example,
              in EPP mode, a byte of data can be transferred to the peripheral
              by a simple OUT instruction. The I/O controller handles all the
              handshaking and data transfer to the peripheral. </p>
            <p align="left">Overall,
              the 1284 standard provides the following:
