              <b>IEEE 1284 Electrical Interface</b></h1>
            <p align="left">The
              original parallel port did not have a defined electrical specification
              that identified the driver, receiver, termination and capacitance
              requirements in order to guarantee any compatibility between devices.
              Host adapters and peripherals were built with any number of pull-up
              values on the control lines, open collector or totem pole drivers
              for the data and control lines, and most offensive of all, up to
              10,000pF capacitors on the data and strobe lines. This type of design
              variation makes it impossible to create a new interface protocol
              without explicitly defining the required electrical parameters with
              which to guarantee operation. </p>
            <p align="left">The
              1284 standard defines two levels of interface compatibility, Level
              I and Level II. The Level I interface is defined for products that
              are not going to operate at the high speed advanced modes, but need
              to take advantage of the reverse channel capabilities of the standard.
              The Level II interface is for devices that will operate in the advanced
              modes, with long cables, and at the higher data rates. This discussion
              will deal primarily with Level II interfaces. Please refer to the
              standard for the full requirements for either a Level I or Level
              II interface. </p>
            <p align="left">The
              requirements for the Level II drivers and receivers are defined
              at the connector interface. The driver requirements are:
            </p><div align="left">
              <ol>
                <li>The
                  open circuit high-level output voltage shall not exceed +5.5V.
                  </li>
                <li>The
                  open circuit low-level output voltage shall be no less than
                  -0.5V. </li>
                <li>The
                  DC steady state, high-level output voltage shall be at least
                  +2.4V at a source current of 14mA. </li>
                <li>The
                  DC steady state, low-level output voltage shall not exceed +0.4V
                  at a sink current of 14mA. </li>
                <li>The
                  driver output impedance (Ro), measured at the connector, shall
                  be 50 +/- 5 ohms at 1/2 the actual driver Voh minus Vol voltage.
                  </li>
                <li>The
                  driver slew rate shall be 0.05-0.40 V/nS </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <p align="left">Like
              the driver requirements, the receiver requirements are defined at
              the connector interface. The receiver requirements are:
            </p><div align="left">
              <ol>
                <li>The
                  receiver shall withstand peak input voltage transients between
                  -2.0V and +7.0V without damage or improper operation. </li>
                <li>The
                  receiver high-level input threshold shall not exceed 2.0V </li>
                <li>The
                  receiver low-level input threshold shall be at least 0.8V. </li>
                <li>The
                  receiver shall provide at least 0.2V input hysteresis, but not
                  more than 1.2V. </li>
                <li>The
                  receiver high-level sink current shall not exceed 20uA at +2.0V.
                  </li>
                <li>The
                  receiver low-level input source current shall not exceed 20uA
                  at +0.8V. </li>
                <li>Circuit
                  and stray capacitance shall not exceed 50pF. </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <p align="left">Figure
              1 shows the recommend termination for a driver/receiver pair. Ro
              represents the output impedance at the connector. It is intended
              that this impedance match the cable impedance so as to minimize
              the noise caused by mismatched impedances. Depending upon the type
              of driver used, a series resistor, Rs may be required to obtain
              the correct impedance.</p>

            <p align="left">There
              are products being introduced by companies such as Texas Instruments
              and National that provide integrated solutions for a 1284 Level
              II interface. These include active drivers and receivers as well
              as resister sip networks. </p>
            <p align="left">NOTE:
              When ECP was first introduced Microsoft made a recommendation for
              an electrical and termination requirement that was not consistent
              with the 1284 specification. This included an AC terminator for
              each of the lines. This suggestion has since been retracted and
              the current recommendation is to use the interface defined in the
              IEEE 1284 specification. </p>
