              <b>Compatibility Mode</b></p>
            <p align="left">This
              mode defines the protocol used by most PCs to transfer data to a
              printer. It is commonly called the "Centronics" mode and
              is the method utilized with the standard parallel port. In this
              mode, data is placed on the port's data lines, the printer status
              is checked for no errors and that it is not Busy, and then a data
              Strobe is generated by the software to clock the data to the printer.
              Figure 1 describes this transfer.</p>

            <p align="left">As
              can be seen, in order to output one byte of data it requires four
              I/O instructions and at least as many additional instructions. The
              net effect of this is a limitation on the bandwidth capabilities
              of the port on the order of 150K bytes per second. This
              bandwidth is sufficient for communicating with dot matrix and many
              older laser printers, but a limitation when communicating with pocket
              LAN adapters, removable disk drives, and the newest generation of
              laser printers, to name a few. Of course, this mode is for the forward
              channel only and must be combined with a reverse channel mode in
              order to have a complete bi-directional channel. This
              mode was included as a way to provide backward compatibility with
              the huge base of installed printers and peripherals. The other modes
              are used to provide the reverse channel and high performance communication
              links. Many
              of the integrated 1284 I/O controllers have implemented a mode that
              uses a FIFO buffer to transfer data with the Compatibility mode
              protocol. This mode is referred to as "Fast Centronics"
              or "Parallel Port FIFO Mode". When this mode is enabled,
              data written to the FIFO port will be transferred to the printer
              using hardware generated strobes for the handshaking. Since there
              is very little latency between transfers, and the software does
              not have to do any of the strobing or handshake checking, data rates
              over 500K bytes per second are achievable with some systems. This
              mode, however, is not an IEEE 1284 defined mode and is not described
              in the standard. </p>
