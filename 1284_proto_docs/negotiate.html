            <h1 align="left"> <b>1284
              Negotiation</b></h1>
            <p align="left">The
              previous sections have identified all of the modes of an IEEE 1284-capable
              interface. Peripherals are not required to implement all of the
              modes. This being the case, a method is needed for a host platform
              to determine what the capabilities of the attached peripheral are,
              and to have a controlled method by which to set the interface into
              one of the modes. </p>
            <p align="left">The
              concept of negotiation was developed to fill this need. Negotiation
              is a sequence of events on the parallel port interface that would
              not effect an older "legacy" device but would provide
              identification of a 1284 peripheral. The concept is that an older
              device will not respond to the negotiation sequence and therefore
              the host would remain in a compatible mode state, while a 1284 peripheral
              would respond to the sequence and could then be set to any of the
              peripheral and host supported modes. </p>
            <p align="left">During
              the negotiation phase, the host places a request on the data lines
              and then initiates the negotiation sequence. The request can be
              to put the interface into a particular mode, or request a device
              ID from the peripheral. Device ID will be discussed later. Figure
              8 shows the basic Negotiation sequence. </p>
            <p align="left">The
              Extensibility byte is used during negotiation to request that the
              peripheral enter a specific transfer mode, or to request that the
              peripheral send a device ID that will allow the host to identify
              the type of attached peripheral. The device ID can be returned in
              any reverse channel mode, other than EPP. Table 1 describes the
              extensibility byte and allowable values. The XFlag is used by the
              peripheral for acknowledgment that the requested mode is available.
              The XFlag will always be set to one (#6 in figure 8) as a positive
              acknowledgment for all requests except for Nibble mode reverse channel.
              All 1284-compliant devices are required to support Nibble mode for
              reverse channel operation. The Extensibility Link request bit is
              used to provide a mechanism for future expansion and addition of
              new operational modes and features. </p>
            <p align="left">Negotiation
              and device ID are key features for the future ability of PC platforms
              to determine system configuration and to include parallel port attached
              peripherals in this determination. </p>
