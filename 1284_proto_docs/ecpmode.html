              ECP Mode</b></h1>
            <p align="left">The Extended
              Capability Port, or ECP, protocol was proposed by Hewlett Packard
              and Microsoft as an advanced mode for communication with printer
              and scanner type peripherals. Like the EPP protocol, ECP provides
              for a high performance bi-directional communication path between
              the host adapter and the peripheral. </p>
            <p align="left">The ECP
              protocol provides the following cycle types in both the forward
              and reverse directions:
            </p><div align="left">

                <li style="color: rgb(0,0,0)" type="disc">Data
                  cycles<br>
                  </li>
                <li style="color: rgb(0,0,0)" type="disc">Command
                  cycles</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <p align="left">The command
              cycles are divided into 2 types, Run-Length Count and Channel address.
              </p>
            <p align="left">Unlike
              EPP, when the ECP protocol was proposed, a standard register implementation
              was also proposed. This can be found in the Microsoft document <a file="ecp_reg.pdf">"The
              IEEE 1284 Extended Capabilities Port Protocol and ISA Interface
              Standard"</a> available from Microsoft Corp. This document
              defines features that are implementation specific which the IEEE
              1284 standard could not address. These features include Run_Length_Encoding
              (RLE) data compression for the host adapters, FIFOs for both the
              forward and reverse channels, and DMA as well as programmed I/O
              for the host register interface. </p>
            <p align="left">The RLE
              feature enables real time data compression that can achieve compression
              ratios up to 64:1. This is particularly useful for printers and
              scanners that are transferring large raster images that have large
              strings of identical data. In order for the RLE mode to be enabled
              both the host and the peripheral must support it. </p>
            <p align="left">Channel
              addressing is, conceptually, a little different than the EPP addressing.
              Channel addressing is intended to be used to address multiple logical
              devices within a single physical device. Think of this in terms
              of a new multi-function device such as FAX/Printer/Modem. Within
              one physical package, having a single parallel port attached, there
              is a printer, fax and modem. Each of these separate functions can
              be thought of as separate logical devices within the same package.
              Using the ECP channel addressing to access each of these devices,
              you could receive data from the modem data device while the printer
              data channel is busy processing a print image. With the compatibility
              mode protocol, if the printer gets busy then no more communication
              can occur until the printer data channel if free. With ECP, the
              software driver simply addresses another channel and communication
              can continue. </p>
            <p align="left">As with
              the other 1284 modes, the ECP protocol redefines the SPP signals
              to be more consistent with the ECP handshake. Table 1 describes
              these signals. </p>

            <p align="left">Figure
              1 shows two forward data transfer cycles. When HostAck is high it
              indicates that a data cycle is taking place. When HostAck is asserted
              low, a command cycle is taking place and the data represents either
              an RLE count or a Channel address. Bit 8, of the data byte is used
              to indicate RLE vs. Channel address. If bit 8 is 0, then bits 1-7
              represent a Run_Length Count (0-127). If bit 8 is 1, then bits 1-7
              represent a Channel address (0-127). Figure 6 shows a data cycle
              followed by a command cycle. </p>
            <p align="left">Figure
              2 shows a reverse channel command cycle followed by a reverse channel
              data cycle. The I/O read or write strobes are not shown in these
              figures. This is because the ECP FIFOs are used to decouple the
              ISA data transfers, either DMA or programmed I/O, from the actual
              host/peripheral data transfers. It is this decoupling of the transfer
              states that makes the ECP protocol a "loosely coupled"
              protocol. The software driver does not know the exact state of the
              data transfers. If a large block is being transferred via DMA, the
              driver does not know if the 123rd byte is being transferred or the
              342,201st byte. As in the case of printers, the software may not
              care. The only concern is whether the transfer was completed or
              not.</p>

            </ol>
            <p align="left">NOTE:
              Since ECP transfers are loosely coupled, with a FIFO possibly on
              both sides of the interface, it is important to note at which step
              the data is considered "transferred". This point occurs
              at step 4, when the HostClk goes high. At this time, the data should
              be clocked in to the peripheral, and any data counters updated.
              There is a condition in the ECP protocol that could cause the transfer
              to abort at between steps 3 and 4. In this case the data should
              not be considered to have been transferred. </p>
            <p align="left">Figure
              2 shows another of the differences between the ECP and EPP protocols.
              With EPP, the software driver may intermix read and write operations
              without any overhead or protocol handshaking. With the ECP protocol,
              changes in the data direction must be negotiated. The host must
              request a reverse channel transfer by asserting nReverseRequest
              and then wait for the peripheral to acknowledge the request by asserting
              nAckReverse. Only then can a reverse channel data transfer take
              place. In addition, since the previous transfer may have been DMA
              driven, the host software must either wait for the DMA to complete,
              or interrupt the DMA, backflush the FIFO to determine the exact
              transferred byte count, and then request the reverse channel. This
              adds a fair amount of overhead with peripherals that require a lot
              of intermixed reading and writing of registers or small buffers.</p>

              This mode is implemented by the SMC FDC37C665/666 controller and
              is not defined by the ECP specification. Most 1284 I/O controllers
              implement the EPP mode in a similar fashion. </p>
            <p align="left">The
              register model for an ECP port is similar to that of the standard
              parallel port, but takes advantage of a significant design oddity
              of the ISA bus architecture. In the IBM compatible PC architecture,
              only the first 1024 I/O ports, or addresses, are used. This is the
              basic I/O space of 0x000h to 0x3ffh. In order to address this range
              of addresses, only 10 address bits are needed (AD0-9). In order
              to save cost, older PC's only drove and decoded these address bits
              on the ISA bus and therefore limited the available I/O space to
              these 1024 registers. Newer PC's, actually drive and decode more
              address bits, enabling a larger available I/O space. This creates,
              in effect, multiple "pages" of the first 1K I/O ports.
              A software driver can access these pages by adding 1024 (0x400h
              hex notation) to the base address being accessed. Therefore, addressing
              addresses 0x378h and 0x778h can access 2 registers on two separate
              pages, but be guaranteed not to interfere with any other installed
              ISA device. The advantage is that by using this "aliasing"
              effect, new cards can have "hidden" registers, thus expanding
              the available number of registers available, and still maintain
              compatibility with older ISA cards that only decode 10 address bits.
              </p>
            <p align="left">The
              ECP register model takes advantage of this and defines 6 registers
              that only require 3 actual I/O ports. Table 9 identifies these registers.
              Note that the register definition may be dependent upon the current
              mode of operation. The ECR register is the most important aspect
              of this register configuration. This is the register that is used
              to set the current operational mode. Additionally, this register
              can be used by software to determine if an ECP-capable port is installed
              in the PC. Detection software can try to access any ECR registers
              by adding 0x402h to the base address of the LPT ports identified
              in the BIOS LPT port table.

            <p align="left">This
              paper will not attempt to describe all the functions of the ECP
              registers. For information regarding the register usage and bit
              definitions, please refer to the Microsoft document or the I/O controller
              data sheet. </p>
            <p align="left">It
              should be noted that if the port is in either standard parallel
              port mode or bi- directional mode, then the first 3 registers behave
              exactly as a standard parallel port. This way, compatibility with
              older devices and device drivers is maintained. </p>
            <p align="left">Usage
              of this port is similar to that of the EPP port. An operational
              mode is written to the ecr register, and then data transfer is accomplished
              by writing or reading from the appropriate I/O port. All of the
              handshaking is automatically generated by the interface controller.
              The major difference is that the ECP port is meant to be driven
              by DMA rather than explicit I/O operations. Again, this is a loosely
              coupled interface that is targeted primarily at peripherals that
              interchange large blocks of data.</p>
