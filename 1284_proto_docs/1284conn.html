              The 1284 standard goes beyond describing new data transfer modes
              and actually defines the mechanical interface and the electrical
              properties of a compliant parallel port. Many of the problems associated
              with parallel port-attached devices arise from the fact that there
              has been no standard for the electrical interface for the parallel
              port. The DB25 female connector has become standard for the PC or
              host connector, but there have been many different implementations
              of the drivers, resistors, capacitors, etc, for electrical the interface.
            
            <p align="left">The
              1284 committee felt that it was paramount to define what these properties
              should be in order to meet the following objectives:
            </p><div align="left">
              <ol>
                <li>Ensure
                  electrical and mechanical compatibility among all 1284 compliant
                  devices. </li>
                <li>Ensure
                  that 1284 interfaces would operate with existing parallel port
                  peripherals and adapters. </li>
                <li>Ensure
                  operation and data integrity at the highest data rates </li>
                <li>Extend
                  operation to 10M (30') </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <p align="left">To
              meet these objectives, the standard defines the connectors, electrical
              interface, and cable requirements. </p>

              standard identifies three types of connectors for a 1284 interface.

            <p align="left">The
              type C connector is the one recommended for new designs. This connector
              offers a smaller footprint than the previous connectors, has a simple-to-use
              clip latch for cable retention, and provides for the easiest cable
              assembly with the optimal electrical properties. In addition, a
              cable assembly built with this connector provides for two more signals.
              These signals are Peripheral Logic High and Host Logic High. These
              signals may be used to determine if the device at the other end
              of the cable is powered on. This enables some degree of intelligent
              power management for 1284 interfaces. <br>
