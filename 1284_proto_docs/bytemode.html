              <b>Byte
              Mode</b></h1>
            <p align="left">With
              later implementations of the parallel port interface, some manufacturers,
              led by IBM on the PS/2 parallel port, added the capability to disable
              the drivers used for driving the data lines, and allowed the data
              port to become an input read data port. This enables a peripheral
              to send an entire byte of data to the PC in one data transfer cycle
              by using the 8 data lines, rather than the two cycles required using
              the Nibble mode. </p>
            <p align="left">This
              ability enables a Byte mode for reverse channel data transfer that
              can be used to provide data rates into the PC approaching that of
              the Compatibility mode, from the PC. This type of port is sometimes
              referred to as a "enhanced bi-directional" port, and has
              caused some confusion when mistaken for an Enhanced Parallel Port
              (EPP). </p>
            <p align="left">The
              following table identifies the Byte mode signal names, and figure
              3 shows the handshake for a Byte mode data transfer. </p>
