          <p><b>EPP
            Mode</b> </p>
        </div>
        <p align="left">The
          Enhanced Parallel Port protocol was originally developed by Intel, Xircom
          and Zenith Data Systems, as a means to provide a high performance parallel
          port link that would still be compatible with the standard parallel
          port. This protocol capability was implemented by Intel in the 386SL
          chipset (82360 I/O chip). This was prior to the establishment of the
          IEEE 1284 committee and the associated standards work. </p>
        <p align="left">The
          EPP protocol offered many advantages to parallel port peripheral manufactures
          and was quickly adopted by many as an optional data transfer method.
          A loose association of around 80 interested manufacturers was formed
          to develop and promote the EPP protocol. This association became the
          EPP Committee and was instrumental in helping to get this protocol adopted
          as one of the IEEE 1284 advanced modes. </p>
        <p align="left">Since
          EPP capable parallel ports were available prior to the release of the
          1284 standard, there is a small deviation between the pre-1284 EPP ports
          and 1284 EPP protocol. This will be made clearer later. </p>
        <p align="left">The
          EPP protocol provides four types of data transfer cycles:
        </p><div align="left">
          <ol>
            <li>Data
              Write Cycle</li>
            <li>Data
              Read Cycle</li>
            <li>Address
              Write Cycle</li>
            <li>Address
              Read Cycle</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p align="left">Data
          cycles are intended to be used to transfer data between the host and
          the peripheral. Address cycles may be used to pass address, channel,
          or command and control information. These cycles can be viewed as just
          two different data cycles. The developer may use and parse the address/data
          information in any method that makes sense for a particular design.

        <p align="left">One
          of the most important features to note here is that the entire data
          transfer occurs within one ISA I/O cycle. The effect is that by using
          the EPP protocol for data transfer, a system can achieve transfer rates
          from 500K to 2M bytes per second. In this fashion, parallel port peripherals
          can operate at close to the same performance levels as an equivalent
          ISA plug-in card. The ability to get this level of performance from
          a parallel port attached device is one of the major features of the
          EPP protocol. With interlocked handshakes, the data transfer will happen
          at the speed of the slowest of the interfaces, the host adapter or the
          peripheral device. This "speed adaptive" property is transparent
          to both the host and peripheral. All 1284 transfer modes are implemented
          with interlocking handshakes.
          </p>
        <p align="left">Interlocking
          refers to the criteria that each control signal transition is acknowledged
          by the opposite side of the interface. In the above diagram, nDataStrobe
          can be asserted because nWAIT is low, nWAIT deasserts in response to
          nDataStrobe be asserted, nDataStrobe deasserts in response to nWAIT
          being deasserted, and finally nWAIT asserts in response to nDataStrobe
          being deasserted. In this way the peripheral can control the setup time
          required for its operation. This is done in the following manner: the
          setup time is the time from the assertion of nDataStrobe to the deassertion
          of nWAIT, the peripherals controls this time. Interlocking also has
          the advantage of making the transfer cycle independent of the cable
          length. The Nibble, Byte, EPP and ECP modes all have interlocked protocols.
          </p>
        <p align="left">As
          previously mentioned, the pre-1284 EPP devices deviated from the 1284
          protocol. At the start of the cycle, the nDataStrobe or nAddrStrobe
          would assert regardless of the state of the nWAIT signal. This means
          that the peripheral could not hold off the start of a cycle by having
          nWAIT deasserted. This is sometimes referred to as EPP 1.7, in reference
          to a Xircom proposal version 1.7. This is the version that Intel implemented
          in the original 82360 I/O controller. A 1284 EPP compatible peripheral
          will work properly with an EPP 1.7 version host adapter, but an EPP
          1.7 peripheral may not operate properly with a 1284 compliant host.

          port, Status port, and Control port. The most common EPP implementations

          <br>
        </div>
        <p align="left">By
          generating a single I/O write instruction to "base_address + 4",
          the EPP controller will generate the necessary handshake signals and
          strobes to transfer the data using an EPP Data_Write cycle. I/O instructions
          to the base addresses, ports 0 through 2, will cause behavior exactly
          as that as to a standard parallel port. This guarantees compatibility
          with standard parallel port peripherals and printers. Address cycles
          are generated when read or write I/O operations are generated to "base_address
          + 3". </p>
        <p align="left">Ports
          5 through 7 are used differently by various hardware implementations.
          These may be used to implement 16 or 32-bit software interfaces, or
          used for configuration registers, or not used at all. For example, the
          Warp Nine Engineering's' F/PortPlus card has only an 8-bit data interface,
          but can be accessed using 32-bit I/O, for EPP data operations. The ISA
          controller will intercept the 32- bit I/O and actually generate 4 fast
          8- bit I/O cycles. The first cycle will be to the addressed I/O port
          using byte 0 (bits 0-7), the second cycle will be to port+1 using byte
          1, then port+2 using byte 2 and finally port+3 using byte 3. These additional
          cycles are generated by hardware and are transparent to the software.
          The total time for these four cycles will be less than 4 independent
          8 bit cycles. For example, the F/PortPlus card (from Warp Nine Engineering)
          maps 4 I/O ports (offset 4 to 7) to the internal EPP Data register.
          This enables the software to use 32-bit I/O operations for EPP data
          transfer. Address cycles are still limited to 8-bit I/O. </p>
        <p align="left">The
          ability to transfer data to or from the PC by the use of a single instruction
          is what enables EPP mode parallel ports to transfer data at ISA bus
          speeds. Rather than having the software implement an I/O intensive software
          loop, a block of data can be transferred with a single REP_IO instruction.
          Depending upon the host adapter port implementation and the capability
          of the peripheral, an EPP port can transfer data from 500K bytes to
          nearly 2M bytes per second. This data transfer rate is more than enough
          to enable network adapters, CD ROM, tape backup and other peripherals
          to operate at nearly ISA bus performance levels. </p>
        <p align="left">The
          EPP protocol and current implementations provide a high degree of coupling
          between the peripheral driver and the peripheral. What this means is
          the software driver is always able to determine and control the state
          of communication to the peripheral at any given time. Intermixing of
          read and write operations as well as block transfers are readily done.
          This type of coupling is ideal for many register-oriented or real-time
          controlled peripherals such as network adapters, data acquisition, portable
          hard drives, and other devices.</p>
